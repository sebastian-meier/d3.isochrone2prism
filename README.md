## Space-Time Prisms Revisited
### Deriving Hägerstrand's space-time visualisations from mobility isochrones

In the 1960/70s Torsten Hägerstrand established what is today know as time(-space) geography. In one of his influential papers, he illustrates the spatio-temporal action space of an individual through space-time prisms (Hägerstrand, 1970). The prisms span across a spatio-temporal coordinate-system, highlighting the space an individual can explore in a given timeframe. The area those prisms cover is influenced by so-called constraints, most importantly personal constraints. Personal constraints can be of biological nature, like age, but also as Hägerstrand says by "the tools [...] [the individuals] can command", in other words, if they, for example, use a car, bike or instead walk.
